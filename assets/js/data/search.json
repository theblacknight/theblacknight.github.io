In Ireland.Very nice to look at though. And still lovely walking weather if you get out early enough.Wrapped up the week with a short kettlebell work out. Don’t want to lose my KB focus while training with barbells.Annoyingly, I tweaked my neck pressing the 32. Feel silly now. I was tired, didn’t sleep great because of the heat, had a few beers last night, probably a bit dehydrated and pretty hungry…Pressing the two 24s felt fine. String even. So did front squats. But 4 sets in that 32 just didn’t go up, I felt a twinge, and now my trap/neck is sore.If I had thought about it rationally at the time, I probably would have left out the 32 after the first set. But rationality and hindsight are good friends.Hopefully it’s all good by Monday.Coming to the end of week 3 now. Starting to feel pretty habitual. I’ve settled into the groove of the routine and am hoping that I can use the spreadsheets as a kind of anchor to bring me back to this point when there is a break in the routine (eg. holidays, traveling for work).Now that I have three weeks of data I should start writing some code to find some patterns in there.

Didn’t go too heavy - I think bench presses are my weakest movement. Much prefer overhead.Met up with some friends for a few beers and a pizza. Was good. Been way to long since we’ve hung out. Should try do that more.Also enjoying the bit of social contact in the gym…I was cynical about it at first, but I think a couple of years of covid and working from home has poisoned my mind a little bit.Gave myself a pretty high mood score today… probably not a coincidence." }, { "title": "Day 18", "url": "/posts/day-0018/", "categories": "daily", "tags": "", "date": "2022-08-11 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Yet another amazing morning. The heat is pretty brutal during the day, needed to just take a cold shower at one point (I’m being dramatic, it’s only 25C, but I’m not used to it). But in the morning, when it’s fresh and bright - kind of hard to be beat just being outside in that.Woke up early today again, was rough sleeping in the heat - even with the chilli pad. Also found that my back was at me - might be time for a new mattress, I feel like that longer I stay in bed the stiffer I am. That may be a mattress issue, or just a fact of life for me.Another Move class at B2B today. Mobility work. It’s pretty brutal at times, a lot of slow movements and cramping muscles.Still have DOMS from this weeks workouts, but generally feeling pretty good physically.I’m not sure how much better things can get from here, but this level of management feels totally bearable. I’d been fine with minor optimizations from here on out. I can live like this and make tweaks. Interested to see how it holds up when the cold comes.All started on Athletic Greens today.

I’ve never really deadlifted before, and naturally I’m a bit concerned about my back.It went well though. Happy enough with the weight and my hamstring / glutes are burning this evening, as they should be. My back feels fine. That means the right muscles were doing the lifting.Overall I felt good today, physically. Wrist is still sore, but topical anti-inflammatory helped a lot. DOMS is still there, but that’s fine. It’s the arthritis related pain that is a problem. Thankfully there’s not much of it today.Been looking into supplement for helping manage arthritis. Specifically ‘Moringa’ and ‘Lions Mane’. The latter is a mushroom. The former is a leaf. Apparently they work wonders… but they would say that…Still though, will try them out. Worth a shot. And they’re not expensive.Going to Theragun this evening and liberally apply magnesium… otherwise I feel like my legs will be very restless tonight.

That morning sunshine on my skin seems like it’s really great for both mood and morning wakefulness.Feeling quite a lot of DOMS today! Changing up the workout (KB to barbell squats, and a lot more volume!) tends to do that, but it’s usually short lived. Can be rough - but it’s totally bearable.My pain levels this morning however… bit of a regression this last couple of days (pain rating was at 15/18 last night and 14 this morning). My lower back wasn’t great, but my wrist - she was really screaming at me. It got a bit better throughout the day, but is very sensitive.Today was my first Move class at B2B and it was great. Massively helped with DOMS as it was mostly static stretching.I like the Lift-Move-Lift-Move-Lift setup at B2B - though still not 100% sure it’s the right place for me.Tomorrow is deadlifts. Will need to make a conscious effort to not push too hard, and avoid letting my ego try to have me keeping up with the rest.One thing I’m concerned about with deadlifts is hamstring tightness. When my hamstrings are tight, my lower back tends to get sore. Will need to figure out how to combat that.

Or smell great.When ever I feel like that, I’m usually stiff too. Lesson learned.Started in Back 2 Basics today. It’s group training. Today was squat day.I’ve never really squatted under a barbell. It’s amazing how much easier it is compared to kettlebell front squats.Workout was good, much faster paced than I’m used to. I think I went a little bit hard. There were a few movements I shouldn’t have done, but powered through. A little sore tonight. Not sure how much is DOMS vs how much is strain.Got a ‘move’ class tomorrow. I’m sure I’ll be stiff.Got a couple of weeks to try this place out, not 100% convinced just yet. But will continue going for the next couple of weeks anyway.Wrist is quite sore today.

In May I went to Atlanta in the US for work. I was there two weeks and it really interrupted my normal routines in terms of exercise and diet. After I got back I felt pretty rough. Pain levels were high, mood was low.At these point I was overrun with nihilistic feelings. Which is pretty typical for me.It’s especially prevalent when breathing is a problem. Sometimes I’ll be sore around the middle of my spine, and either side of it. If I take a deep, the expansion of my rib cage triggers a kind of spasm in my back/back ribs. Imagine someone standing beside you, pointing a bony but strong looking finger at you. Every time you breath deep they stab you with that finger, right in the ribs. That’s kind of what it’s like. The noise you make sounds something like ‘hrmfff’.I know I can feel better, but it can be hard. Best I’ve felt was during a restrictive elimination diet. I was eating nothing but sweet potatoes, eggs, salad, nuts and broccoli. I did it for a few weeks and felt great. But it was totally unsustainable. Over time I feel back into poor eating habits.There are two things that I tend to get excessive with. Dark chocolate rice cakes and mint crisp chocolate bars. The rice cakes are in the health section of the supermarket… but I usually eat a full packet, which is a lot of sugar.This time I’m easing more gently into better habits. Writing things down, tracking stats. Sustainable but extremely conscientious. That’s what I’m going forMovementNot much has changed in terms of exercise this past two weeks. But that morning routine. Really happy with that.Tomorrow I start in B2B. Group training in a gym setting. My first time ever training in a gym, and my first time with a barbell. Looking forward to it - want to try hitting some heavier weight than is possible with my kettlebells.My current KB front squat is 80% bodyweight for ten. I’m interested to see how that translates to barbell back squat.I’ll be lifting three days this week. B2B also has a movement class, which covers mobility work. Really looking forward to that one. Will do that twice next week.FoodDidn’t change much around food this week. Have generally kept it low in added sugar and maintained an 16 hour fasting window.Trying to vary my diet more. I tend to get stuck making the same thing over and over. Sweet potato, broccoli, eggs… every day.Avoiding bloat seems like it’s critical for me. I’ve suspected for a long time that more pressure on my digestive system comes with more pain for me. Aiming for ‘mildly hungry, most of the time’ seems to work well. Interested to see how it impacts body composition and strength.MiscI’m going to introduce a mood score from this week. As I’ve mentioned elsewhere, blocking Reddit on my phone feels like it has to a general improvement in my mood. Interested to see how this mood score relates to things like sleep and pain levels.I’ve also started creating some graphs to represent the data I’m gathering over time. Will need a few more months of data to start seeing interesting correlations I reckon. I will also try pull some temperature/humidity data to go with it.

Eating more than enough and supplementing where needed. The key is avoiding any sort of grazing or bloating.I been waking up earlier naturally too. Less sluggish. Being more strict around not eating 1-2 hours before bed makes a huge difference I think.I’ll probably try to eat more earlier in the day and keep it light in the evening. ie. Big lunch, small dinner.Was watching a short documentary earlier about a place in Mexico where Coca-Cola consumption is higher than anywhere else in the world.

My pain levels dropped immediately. Some of the numbers I’m putting in the pain register would have been much higher just one month ago.I reckon this is mostly because of two things: Morning routine I think this is very valuable. A ten minute investment that yields great returns through out the day. More hunger. I am eating well, but avoiding snacking while also intermittent fasting. I seem to feel better physically when I’m a little it hungry. I definitely have problems if I eat too much over the course of a day, such that I’m never really hungry. Grazing.

Here’s a little more detail on each element:Hang from a barI hang from my pullup bar for around 60 seconds. This really unlocks and loosens my shoulders and upper back.I’ve included it mainly for a bit of spinal decompression first thing in the morning, but I think it’s a good idea in general.Original strength routineThis is a routine I got from Dan John. You can see it in action here. For my morning routine I just do the first minute of that video. I find it helps me to lossen up.Sun salutationsThis is a quick bit of Yoga. I basically go from downward facing dog, to chaturanga, to upward facing dog, back to downard facing dog. And repeat.This is a great one for stretching out my back.Deep squatI like to just hang out in a deep squat. Opens the hits, works my back a little bit and just generally feels good.Push ups10 push ups. Get some blood flowing.Shoudler dislocationsI take a resistance band and hold it with both hands, arm straight out in front. Then lift my arms up overhead and then back and down behind me. Good to get the shoulders moving.WalkI just walk. 20 minutes. This gets me out into the sun (in the summer) first thing in the morning, which is something I’ve seen recommended by a number of people I respect, including Andrew Huberman (neurobiologist) and Rangan Chatterjee (Physician).That’s it for the morning routine. My workouts didn’t change much this week. I’m waiting to hear back from B2B fitness in Dublin. Would like to do a barbell program for a while. Have kind of hit my limit with kettlebells for a while I think, don’t want to get bored.FoodI also made some minor tweaks around diet. I’ve been really avoiding eating at night time. I have a really bad habit of consolidating all of my snacking into the 2-3 hours before I go to bed.If I go to bed feeling even a little bloated I always feel worse the next day. So I’ve tried to follow a more strict 16-8 intermittent fasting pattern, which sees me starting the fast at around 9.I started drinking protein shakes again too. Since I’ll be reducing the amount of calories I’m eating, through cutting out as much sugar and processed food as possible, I want to make sure I’m still getting enough protein.I use Vivo Life protein. It’s plant based and fermented, which makes it a lot easier on my gut. I can’t really do whey protein - makes me feel awful. Downside is that it is crazy expensive!I’ve also started taking creatine. Interested to see how it affects my workouts (if at all).MiscNothing much to cover here. Just getting started!The one thing worth mentioning is that tracking this stuff in a spreadsheet has been really motivational for me. It definitely helps me to stay disciplined throughout the day. Knowing that my actions are being recorded and analysed, even if it’s just me looking at it, adds some real accounability.
