## What is this all about?
My name is Kev, I'm 37 (at the time of writing) and I live in Dublin, Ireland. Professionally, I make computer games. More specifically, I've spent the last 15 or so years writing code that runs on servers (the things that your computer/phone connects to when you use the internet).

### What/who is this for?
It's mostly just for me. A journal that I don't really expect anyone else to read. 

Generally in life I think it helps to write things down, sort your thoughts out. 

My thoughts, in this case, are all about living, and even thriving, with arthritis.

Arthritis is a prick.

In the last 18 or so years I don't think I can really remember a day when I wasn't in some sort of pain or discomfort. Sometimes mild, sometimes severe. It can be bad to the point where just existing is painful, where it hurts to breath; or mild to point where it's not painful, but you are aware that one wrong move could leave you in a lot of pain.  

Generally I wake up in the morning and I'm stiff. I get a daily preview of what it's like to be 70 (it's not great). Throughout the day, and with movement, this tends to get better.

When I was younger (~19 years old) I thought I just had a bad back. Physios' told me that I probably had a bulging disk. Doctors told me my blood tests were all clear. 

This kind of made sense to me, as I spent a lot of time sitting at a desk working with computers, so I just assumed that was taking it's toll on me. But things got progressively worse.

I would later learn that diagnosing this condition can be pretty difficult.

In 2019 I was official diagnosed, at the age of 34, with [Psoriatic Spondylitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriatic_arthritis). I already knew I had psoriasis (a skin condition that also sucks), it runs in the family. But a percentage of people with psoriasis also have a related form of inflammatory arthritis.

In my case, it mostly affects my spine (that's the spondylitis part) and SI joint. But also noticeabley affects my left wrist and right big toe.

### So what are you doing?
Fighting it...

I'm trying to manage the condition as best I can, without the use of heavy duty drugs.

#### Why not take the drugs?
The drug I was recommended ([Humera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalimumab#Adverse_effects)) comes with potential side effects and I don't like the idea of being dependent on a drug company (you need to taper off, you can't just stop taking it).

I don't have a problem with the drugs, and wouldn't discourage anyone from taking them. I just consider them an absolute last resort, which in the long run could prove to be a bad decision.

### How will this work?
I've created a spreadsheet to track my day to day activities, to see if there are things I can do that really have an impact on how I feel and move on any given day.

This includes morning/evening stretching routines, workouts, diet, sleep quality etc... I'll change it up and monitor over time. 

I'll also consume as much reading/podcast material as I can find on pain and arthritis. Do some learning.
	
And I want to write about it daily. For record and accountability. 

*Note: There will be a few days lag in posts; want to allow for editing and schedule issues.*
