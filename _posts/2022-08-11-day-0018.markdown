Yet another amazing morning. The heat is pretty brutal during the day, needed to just take a cold shower at one point (I'm being dramatic, it's only 25C, but I'm not used to it). But in the morning, when it's fresh and bright - kind of hard to be beat just being outside in that.

Woke up early today again, was rough sleeping in the heat - even with the chilli pad. Also found that my back was at me - might be time for a new mattress, I feel like that longer I stay in bed the stiffer I am. That may be a mattress issue, or just a fact of life for me.

Another Move class at B2B today. Mobility work. It's pretty brutal at times, a lot of slow movements and cramping muscles.

Still have DOMS from this weeks workouts, but generally feeling pretty good physically. 

I'm not sure how much better things can get from here, but this level of management feels totally bearable. I'd been fine with minor optimizations from here on out. I can live like this and make tweaks. Interested to see how it holds up when the cold comes.

All started on Athletic Greens today. I've heard them talked about by Rich Roll, Joe Rogan, Andrew Huberman and others. I respect them enough to give it a shot. Actually tastes pretty good for a green juice. Let's see how that goes too.
