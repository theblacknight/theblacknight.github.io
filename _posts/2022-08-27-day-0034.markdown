Stiff again this morning. Went for a walk and got a workout in and felt a bit better, but this has been the worst I've been since I started this process.

Totally bearable, but not great.

Then I went into town to visit a jeweler and have lunch. Between the drive, sitting in a jewelers and then sitting in a restaurant - all pretty uncomfortable - I felt pretty rough.

I ended up taking a painkiller. My SI joint felt pretty inflamed, so I what to just nip that in the bud. That's the second pill I've taking in the 34 days so far. I think that's a fine cadence for that sort of thing.

Overall, not a great day. When my hips are at me I do this sort of cowboy walk. Legs splayed a bit wider than they'd normally be. At least the painkiller will help with the sleep tonight. Hopefully.
