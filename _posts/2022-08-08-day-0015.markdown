We're getting spoiled this summer. Was lovely and warm this morning when I went for my walk.

I walk for 1.6 kilometers, or 1 mile. Takes about 20 minutes.

Felt a bit of a regression when I woke up this morning. This I went too heavy on the cheese last night. Some haloumi for dinner, then a nibble of some Gouda. Gut didn't feel great this morning. Or smell great.

When ever I feel like that, I'm usually stiff too. Lesson learned.

Started in Back 2 Basics today. It's group training. Today was squat day. 

I've never really squatted under a barbell. It's amazing how much easier it is compared to kettlebell front squats. 

Workout was good, much faster paced than I'm used to. I think I went a little bit hard. There were a few movements I shouldn't have done, but powered through. A little sore tonight. Not sure how much is DOMS vs how much is strain.

Got a 'move' class tomorrow. I'm sure I'll be stiff.

Got a couple of weeks to try this place out, not 100% convinced just yet. But will continue going for the next couple of weeks anyway.

Wrist is quite sore today. Was sore first thing. Sore again now.
