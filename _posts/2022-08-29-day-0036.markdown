Today was ok pain wise, definitely a lot better than I was over the weekend. 

Started the new block in B2B, which is strength focused. It was nice, bit of a slower pace, more focused on strength building. Bench press still feels weak, but my pull ups and overhead press are feeling strong.

Need to figure out a routine for when my mid/upper back is tight. I can crack it - but it feels like I'm in need of some mobility work there. Extension and rotation are needed I think. I have some stretches for extension and flexion - but it still just feels immobile... something to work on.

Sat on the couch for a while tonight. This definitely makes me stiff. My secret labs chair is fine - can do hours in it, but not the couch.
