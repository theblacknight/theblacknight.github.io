General low grade stiffness all over this morning. Was a damp dull morning. A pretty welcome break from the persistent sun of the last couple of weeks.

Squats today. Went up to 95kg for 4. Felt pretty decent. 

Had to bring Mona to the vet. That's more stressful than the work outs.

Felt pretty ok for most of the day. Stiff in the morning and stiffened up in the evening. 

Move class tomorrow, looking forward to that. Felt great afterwards last time.

Will think about making some changes soon. Want the heat to settle down and see what effect better sleep has.
