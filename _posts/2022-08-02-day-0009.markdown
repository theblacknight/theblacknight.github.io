Another pretty decent day today. Started off pretty stiff, but once I got my morning routine done I was good to go. 

Slept terribly though. Was warm and I was restless. Mona got in another fight with that prick SIdney, so I was woken up in the middle of the night too. Went out side to chase him off. Stepped on a slug. In my bare feet.

Did the usual Tuesday Yoga. Felt good, as usual.

Wrist is still pretty sore. When it flares up it usually flares for a while. It's a tricky on because it's easlly to accidentally but stress on a write. Picking up something light but doing it awkwardly is enough to strain it more.
