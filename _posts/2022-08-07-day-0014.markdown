Another beautiful day in Dublin.

Went for a nice long walk this morning, hour and a bit. I feel like I'm going to miss the early morning summer brightness when it's gone.

Did a bit of yoga too. Feeling good mobility wise.

I'll talk more about this in the weekly post, but I think maintaining a low level hunger consistently works well for me. Definitely not starving myself. Eating more than enough and supplementing where needed. The key is avoiding any sort of grazing or bloating.

I been waking up earlier naturally too. Less sluggish. Being more strict around not eating 1-2 hours before bed makes a huge difference I think. 

I'll probably try to eat more earlier in the day and keep it light in the evening. ie. Big lunch, small dinner. 

Was watching a short documentary earlier about a place in Mexico where Coca-Cola consumption is higher than anywhere else in the world. People are drinking two liters of the stuff a day.

Unsurprisingly, they have record levels of diabetes, major dental problems and 30% of the population is obese.

Made me really glad to have been able to acquire the knowledge I have, and live where I live. I shudder to think how I would feel physically if I had grown up with that. I could have been crippled by my arthritis...

Sugar is a real problem.
