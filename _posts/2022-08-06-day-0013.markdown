Felt pretty good getting up this morning, but at some point my left shoulder started to hurt. Not an arthritis sort of pain, but more like a strain from the heavy presses yesterday.

Got through a work out, but it wasn't great. 

Another lovely morning for a walk this morning, and still really enjoying the morning routine.

Over the past 1.5 weeks I've had Reddit blocked on my phone. I had fallen into the habit of checking it regularly. Taking out my phone and loading up the website had become a bit habitual. A habit that I think got worse over Covid lockdown. 

Anyway, I blocked it so that even if the automatic, boredom triggered, habit fires - I won't be able to load the site.

I think my general mood throughout the day has improved as a result. Doom scrolling on Reddit always just felt like a negative experience. But an addictive one.

As the evening progressed I got quite a bit more stiff. Think my couch posture while watching a movie tonight didn't help.
