Met a friend for a walk and catch up today.

He also has arthritis at a young age. Actually what he has is 'Ankylosing spondylitis'.

We have a very similar experience of pain, stiffness, flare ups and frustration. It's good to talk to someone in a similar place, who is also trying to manage it in similar ways.

We've both improved a lot through careful management of diet, exercise and routine. It's hard and it's constant but it really does seem to help.

Felt generally good today and had a mobility class in the evening - after which I felt amazing. 

Mobility and stretching is interesting. You need to be so consistent to get the benefits, and I don't think people appreciate how hard it can be.

Sure, doing a little stretching is easy. Just like lifting weights that are too light to actually challenge you is easy.

But when you are trying to push the bounds of your flexibility and mobility - it gets real hard real quick. Some mobility work, I reckon, is hard than strength work.
