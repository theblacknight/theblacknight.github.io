Bench pressing today - definitely my least favourite movement. Probably because it's my weakest... need to keep weight light and work on technique for a bit I think.

Felt ok overall today, but started to stiffen up towards the evening. Sitting on the couch might do it. Though I did have some horribly rich and sickly sweet vegan deserts. I shouldn't eat that stuff.

Might be heading to Colorado for a week with work... will be interesting to see how well I can tolerate this disruption. Atlanta messed me up...
