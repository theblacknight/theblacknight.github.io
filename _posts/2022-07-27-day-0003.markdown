Woke up with a stiff neck today. I got a new pillow recently enough, but feels like the support it provided initially has already started to disappear. 

Mona (our cat) slept in the bed last night, between me and Claudia. She doesn't always sleep there, but when she does I usually have a worse nights sleep. You just can't move around as freely and get comfortable when you're concious of crushing your cat... and she is hogging the sheets.

Towards the end of the day my back started to feel stiff... I'm wondering if one arm presses on my left hand side are the cause. Went pretty high volume today. Could be a problem with my form. Been thinking about getting a coach recently. Seems like a good idea.

Went for an evening walk - was a nice evening, perfect walking temparature. 

There's a house nearby that might be a crack house. Still looking for evidence to support this claim.
