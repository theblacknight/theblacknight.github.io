My whole spine felt stiff this morning. After I did my morning routine and went for a longer than usual walk I felt a lot better. Though my upper back on the left side has been bad all day. Breathing has been tight. It's like my ribcage is clenched.

Thinking I might need to take it easy on the overhead presses for a bit. Could be an intercostal muscle issue. Could also be arthritis related. Thinking I should try get an MRI on my upper spine. I've only had lower back/hips done to date.

Interestingly, writing down the food I'm eating (not calorie counting, just brief notes) is kind of interrupting habitual/boredom related eating patterns. When I find myself Zombie-ing around the kitchen, gravitating towards snacks,  I think to myself "I'm going to have to write this down", which is just enough of a nudge to make me reconsider and remember the goal.
