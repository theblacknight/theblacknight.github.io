Woke up feeling a bit rough today. My upper back was tight and breathing was a bit uncomfortable. Got up and did my routine as normal, but my upper back still felt tight.

At around lunch time it finally 'clicked' and the pressure was relieved. 

My upper back seems to be much more problematic lately. It used to mainly be my hips and lower back that were an issue. I find it much easier to work on hip mobility than t-spine - but I really need to get a routine in place there for improving that.

Move class today, felt good afterwards, as usual. My wrist mobility let me down in this one - need to get back to working on my wrists too. Sent ages improving my mobility there a few years back - and looking back I did actually make a lot of progress. I'm so much less mobile now than I was then.

So - two things to think about. T-spine and wrist...
