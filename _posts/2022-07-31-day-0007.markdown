Went for a long walk this morning. Pretty miserable morning, but was a nice walk. Saw a crane (the bird, not the machine).

Did some yoga too. Generally felt good throughout the day.

There is something about walking. No matter how stiff or in pain I am, a walk always seems to help. 

Drove out to Westwood Club in Leopardstown to see how much of a hassle that is. Was considering joining. Don't think I'd like to do that drive regularly. Leaning towards B2B. Also drove around Foxrock. Houses around there are insane. Basically just a load of castles.

Then spent a few hours with my family, then Claudias'. Was good. Met my cousins daughter for the first time. Not sure what she is to me. Second cousin? Should look that up.

Was a good day.
