I lot colder in the mornings now - still ok for shorts and a t-shirt, but feeling the chill.

Felt pretty good today. No DOMS after deadlift day which is nice, though I did feel generally tired. Forearms were wiped out. Maye nervous system taking a while to recover.

Another Move class, and I felt great again after this one. Some pretty tough stretches an positions to get into, but was able to manage most of it pretty well. Definitely feel limited in my ability to hinge when sitting, legs open. I'm pretty mobile in every position other than this one.
