Another amazing morning for a walk. I feel like I need to keep saying it. To be grateful while it lasts.

Went for a longer walk than I usually do in the morning, around 40 minutes instead of 20.

It was deadlift day at B2B. I've never really deadlifted before, and naturally I'm a bit concerned about my back.

It went well though. Happy enough with the weight and my hamstring / glutes are burning this evening, as they should be. My back feels fine. That means the right muscles were doing the lifting.

Overall I felt good today, physically. Wrist is still sore, but topical anti-inflammatory helped a lot. DOMS is still there, but that's fine. It's the arthritis related pain that is a problem. Thankfully there's not much of it today.

Been looking into supplement for helping manage arthritis. Specifically 'Moringa' and 'Lions Mane'. The latter is a mushroom. The former is a leaf. Apparently they work wonders... but they would say that...

Still though, will try them out. Worth a shot. And they're not expensive.

Going to Theragun this evening and liberally apply magnesium... otherwise I feel like my legs will be very restless tonight. They get like that when my hamstrings are tight.

Another Move class tomorrow. Looking forward to that.
