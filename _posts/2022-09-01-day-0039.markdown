Had a rough night last night. Woke up at 3am and didn't really get back to sleep. Was uncomfortable and tossing and turning a lot.

This happens from time to time. I really struggle with sleep.

I've tried multiple things to help:

* No screens close to bed
* Keep the room dark
* Go to bed at consistent times

And I think those things do help in that I usually fall asleep pretty quickly. But after a few hours of sleep my body stiffens up (I assume from being in the same position for so long). So when I do wake up I'm uncomfortable. 

I've had nights before where I woke myself up by breathing. The pain caused by my expanding rib cage can be enough to wake me up.

So once I wake I find it difficult to get back asleep - that's what my main issue is.

Bad sleep can easily lead to bad everything else (food choices, relationship stress, lethargy and laziness etc...).

So today was kind of mentally exhausting. Got a good move class in though - taking an hour to stretch seems like it's always a good idea.
