Went for a nice long walk around Tibradden this morning with Claudia. Was a lovely morning and we walked for a couple of hours, up to the cairn and over to fairy castle.

I did, however, feel pretty stiff afterwards. I went up in my barefoots today, which I don't usually do. As a result, I was walking a lot on the balls of my feet, which of course buts pressure on my calves.

I think tired/tight calves kind of ripples up my legs and into my hamstrings, hips and lower back. I hit them with the Theragun and they were pretty sensitive - but that quick Theregun session seemed to reduce the stiffness in my hips and lower back.

Overall it wasn't a great day pain wise. Those days suck - can really bring you down. Squats tomorrow - usually I feel great after squats, so fingers crossed. Also starting a 'strength block' - so looking forward to seeing the programming there.
