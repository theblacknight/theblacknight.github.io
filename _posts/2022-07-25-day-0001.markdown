Monday - Squat day. I always feel good after squats. They seem to help my lower back.

Lately the pain has been focused more in my mid back. It's never nice when it gets like this, because breathing can be painful. The expansion of my rib cage can trigger a bit of a spasm. Sometimes it's enough to make you weak at the knees.

I've been doing Kettlebell Front squats - which probably isn't helping. They require that your upper body, including upper back, work pretty hard. Though I beat my best in terms of reps and weight today (two 32kg Kettlebells, three sets of eight, which is ~80% of my bodyweight). That felt good. 

I work out exclusively with kettlebells and bodyweight. The main reason being I like to work out at home, and I have both of those things in my home.

I also walk at least a mile every day, first thing in the morning. I feel like it's a good idea. It's warm in the mornings at the moment, nice walking weather.
