Waking up in Ireland lately has been like waking up in Gran Canaria.

Blue skies, warm air and sun shining all day. Really being spoiled with walking conditions - gonna miss it when it's gone. That morning sunshine on my skin seems like it's really great for both mood and morning wakefulness. 

Feeling quite a lot of DOMS today! Changing up the workout (KB to barbell squats, and a lot more volume!) tends to do that, but it's usually short lived. Can be rough - but it's totally bearable. 

My pain levels this morning however... bit of a regression this last couple of days (pain rating was at 15/18 last night and 14 this morning). My lower back wasn't great, but my wrist - she was really screaming at me. It got a bit better throughout the day, but is very sensitive.

Today was my first **Move** class at B2B and it was great. Massively helped with DOMS as it was mostly static stretching. 

I like the Lift-Move-Lift-Move-Lift setup at B2B - though still not 100% sure it's the right place for me.

Tomorrow is deadlifts. Will need to make a conscious effort to not push too hard, and avoid letting my ego try to have me keeping up with the rest.

One thing I'm concerned about with deadlifts is hamstring tightness. When my hamstrings are tight, my lower back tends to get sore. Will need to figure out how to combat that. Maybe a long session with my Theragun afterwards.
