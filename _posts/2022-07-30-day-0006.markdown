Saturdays for me usually involve two things:

1. Trip to a farmers market first thing in the morning
2. Pull day

They are the two constants and I'm usually done before lunch. The rest of the day is free.

Feeling pretty good today. Bit of a twinge in the lower back this morning, but nothing else serious, though my left wrist still isn't great.

Wrist issues come and go. I think it's usually due to heavy kettlebell cleans coupled with guitar. 

I often worry that I just won't be able to play guitar anymore... not that I'm any good at it or anything, but I enjoy picking up a guitar from time to time.

One thing that has definitely helped my wrists in genral is an ergonomic keyboard and mouse. If you sit at a desk, an ergonomic keyboard is definitely worth gettiing, and getting used to.

Claudia's nephew opened a pizza truck today, so we went to check that out. He makes amazing pizza and did not disappoint. 

Mona nearly got in another fight last night. The other cat's name is Sidney and she's already had to go in for surgery once because of him. Prick.
