Last week I talked about my first memory of a flare up. Of a crippling pain that I didn't really understand, but dismissed as 'I just have a bad back'.

## The college years

Throughout college I remember a few flare ups, but it never got bad enough to the point where I tried to figure out what was **really** going on.

At this point it's worth talking about lifestyle. I was drinking and smoking a decent amount over the four years I spent in college. We'd usually hit the pub or head to a session in someones house on Thursday, Friday and Saturday each week.

The rest of the time I was in college or sitting on my ass. I was not very active at all, outside of the walks to and from college. No sport, no exercise, nothing like that. I was either at a computer or sitting on a couch.

I also didn't eat very well. At this point in my life I had never really eaten vegetables or anything like that. My food was mostly beige.

Bread rolls will with meet and cheese. Potatoes, bread, cheese, ham, chicken, steak were my staples. Washed down with coke and followed by chocolate or crisps (chips for you Americans) for dessert.

I was getting through college just fine, I was learn how to build software and enjoyed it. But I wasn't exactly a fine physical specimen, I definitely wasn't fit or strong and I wasn't investing in my body for the future.

There was also one final vice in my live... one that deserves it's own section.
