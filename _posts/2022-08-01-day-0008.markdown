Felt pretty good today. Went for two walks, one long one short. Also squat day, and once again felt great after squats. 

Sat at my computer for a while, which I think stiffened by back up a bit. Need to move at more regular intervals. Maybe forward folds? Twice per hour? Might try that. Couldn't hurt to throw in a deep squat too. Maybe a hip flexor stretch to work against the sitting.

Wrist feels a bit better, which is good. I put ice on it for a while. Seemed to help. Need to buy some wrist supports though I think.

Been very warm this past week or so. The pull up bar gets slippy. I figure out that I can wrap a resitance band around it for a better grip. Can really feel a transfer of effort from my grip to my back muscles.

I think tonights pain score is the lowest so far. I think I will work on getting some graphs this week. Only a weeks worth of data, which isn't that useful, but it's enough to figure out what graphs to create and have a think about interesting data points.
