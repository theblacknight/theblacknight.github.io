Been getting a bit busier in work lately - lots of work with people in the US, meaning late evening/night calls, meaning my routine is a bit tougher to manage. It's not great.

Feeling a bit stiff today. Hamstrings are tight, which always comes with a little lower back stiffness. Nothing serious - but I'm aware of it.

Had a move class, which is always nice - felt loose afterwards. My mobility limits are definitely in my shoulders and upper back. Hips and legs are all good at these points. Unsurprisingly, that is the area that is easier to stretch. Need to incorporate more upper body stuff into my stretching and mobility routines.
