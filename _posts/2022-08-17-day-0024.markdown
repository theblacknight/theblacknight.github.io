Dull, cool and damp this morning. Nice to walk in the cold for a change.

Deadlifts today. Felt pretty good, and my body is feeling pretty good after. Deadlifting really wipes you had, you can feel the exhaustion in your nervous system.

I think I need to get a few more different foods into rotation. Want to keep the diet interesting, but 'clean'.
