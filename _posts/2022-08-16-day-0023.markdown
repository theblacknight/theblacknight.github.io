A lot colder today, still a nice morning for a walk though. Did the short route today. Giving myself a bit of a break.

Starting to feel the grind a little now. The initial motivation of the first two weeks of filling out logs has worn off. Will need to push through on discipline for a while... eventually it will become routine.

Overall it only takes about 20 minutes a day to write these little notes and fill out my sheet. The resistance is there, even when it's such a small time investment. 

One bit of friction I might remove is writing in the morning rather than the evening. It's easier for me to write these in the morning, schedule wise. I had wanted to do it at night so the day was a bit more fresh in my mind - but I think morning posts should be fine. Probably better. My brain is better in the morning.
