It has been two weeks since I started tracking metrics about my day to day life in order to better manage my Psoriatic arthritis.

I'm surprised how much better a feel relative to just a few weeks ago. In May I went to Atlanta in the US for work. I was there two weeks and it really interrupted my normal routines in terms of exercise and diet. After I got back I felt pretty rough. Pain levels were high, mood was low. 

At these point I was overrun with nihilistic feelings. Which is pretty typical for me. 

It's especially prevalent when breathing is a problem. Sometimes I'll be sore around the middle of my spine, and either side of it. If I take a deep, the expansion of my rib cage triggers a kind of spasm in my back/back ribs. Imagine someone standing beside you, pointing a bony but strong looking finger at you. Every time you breath deep they stab you with that finger, right in the ribs. That's kind of what it's like. The noise you make sounds something like 'hrmfff'.

I know I can feel better, but it can be hard. Best I've felt was during a restrictive elimination diet. I was eating nothing but sweet potatoes, eggs, salad, nuts and broccoli. I did it for a few weeks and felt great. But it was totally unsustainable. Over time I feel back into poor eating habits.

There are two things that I tend to get excessive with. Dark chocolate rice cakes and mint crisp chocolate bars. The rice cakes are in the health section of the supermarket... but I usually eat a full packet, which is a lot of sugar.

This time I'm easing more gently into better habits. Writing things down, tracking stats. Sustainable but extremely conscientious. That's what I'm going for


## Movement

Not much has changed in terms of exercise this past two weeks. But that morning routine. Really happy with that.

Tomorrow I start in B2B. Group training in a gym setting. My first time ever training in a gym, and my first time with a barbell. Looking forward to it - want to try hitting some heavier weight than is possible with my kettlebells. 

My current KB front squat is 80% bodyweight for ten. I'm interested to see how that translates to barbell back squat.

I'll be lifting three days this week. B2B also has a movement class, which covers mobility work. Really looking forward to that one. Will do that twice next week.

## Food

Didn't change much around food this week. Have generally kept it low in added sugar and maintained an 16 hour fasting window. 

Trying to vary my diet more. I tend to get stuck making the same thing over and over. Sweet potato, broccoli, eggs... every day.

Avoiding bloat seems like it's critical for me. I've suspected for a long time that more pressure on my digestive system comes with more pain for me. Aiming for 'mildly hungry, most of the time' seems to work well. Interested to see how it impacts body composition and strength.

### Misc

I'm going to introduce a mood score from this week. As I've mentioned elsewhere, blocking Reddit on my phone feels like it has to a general improvement in my mood. Interested to see how this mood score relates to things like sleep and pain levels.

I've also started creating some graphs to represent the data I'm gathering over time. Will need a few more months of data to start seeing interesting correlations I reckon. I will also try pull some temperature/humidity data to go with it. I've also long suspected that drastic changes in humidity aren't great for me.
