Every Tuesday I do the same Yoga session. 

[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1VUTQCCgdw), day 7 of [Yoga With Adrienne's](https://www.youtube.com/c/yogawithadriene) 2022 '30 day Yoga journey' (she does this '30 day journey' every January).

There's something about this particular Yoga flow that just works for me. It has a lot of twists in it, which seem to loosen up my spine.

Overall I actually felt pretty good today. Standing up out of a chair was fluid and easy, as was moving around. One of those 'good days' - trying to really appreciate them when they come.

That's one thing that chronic pain definitely does for you - makes you appreciate those brief periods when there is just nothing. It's like your mind just empties out. It's not distracted by the pain. You feel lighter. 

Made me think about how, on any given day, you are always carrying some sort of load. It's nice to have a day where the load is a little lighter.
