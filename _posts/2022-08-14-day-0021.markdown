Very overcast a humid this morning. I woke up very stiff. Another night with a pretty shitty sleep.

Went for a long walk this morning to loosen up, which helped a bit. I neck was sore all day, cervical spine area. 

Hung out with some friends for a while, but felt a bit wrecked. Don't think I ate enough lunch. Been meaning to start eating a bigger lunch and a smaller dinner. Avoid bloating in the evenings.

Three weeks in and this has been an interesting process. Feels good to be writing again. Has felt easy so far to stay on the path.

Got a day off work tomorrow, which is nice. Want to do some more writing. Probably prep some food. Since I'm going to the gym now it would be good to get back on top of that sort of thing I think.
