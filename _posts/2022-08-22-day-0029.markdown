I'm still waking up early with back issues. 

It's as if five or so hours of sleep, of laying in a static position, results in this pain in my mid back. 

I suspect that the mattress I currently have isn't providing the support I need. I think it sags a little right around my mid spine. So what ends up happening is that I lay on my side, then that gets sore and uncomfortable so I switch to my other side, which kind of balances out the spinal position. 

So my spine is bending one way for a while, then the other. Rinse, repeat.

It's quite disruptive for my sleep.

So I felt pretty tired, and still sore from last weeks workouts going into squat day.

BUT I managed a set of 4 squats are 100kg. That is 1.25% bodyweight, which is by far the heaviest weight I've had my body under. 

And the felt good, really good. Getting close to that 1.5x bodyweight goal. 

I'm really starting to believe that figuring out a way to do some weight training should be the first treatment option for anyone dealing with arthritis. 

That's not to say you need to be lifting really heavy. Just lift something. Move the joints and build the muscle around them.

Mobility and strength. These might just be the key.

The pain is still there, but I can move well and I am reasonably strong...

I'll take that.
