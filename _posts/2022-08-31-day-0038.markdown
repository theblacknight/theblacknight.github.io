Squat day today - I love squat day. 

I felt a little rough in the morning. Upper back and left upper back (ribs) were at me. 

It was one of those days where I feel apprehensive about working out. Like I'm not going to be up for it physically.

Whenever I feel like this I go ahead and work out anyway. See what I can actually do.

For some reason, on those days I usually do best.

Hit the highest reps for the heaviest weight I've hit to date today (1.25x bodyweight for 5). So that felt good. Pull ups also felt great today!

Started to stiffen up again towards the evening. Spending time on the couch is definitely an issue...

By the time I went to bed it was my ribs that were at me. Still now sure if that is arthritis or intercostal muscle strain. Should get it checked out...
