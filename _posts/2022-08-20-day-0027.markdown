Woke up very sore this morning. My upper back, mid spine felt like it was pinching me, hard, whenever I took a breath.

I blame the vegan, sugar laden cookie/brownie I had last night. Didn't have much - but it was enough. Lesson learned. Again...

The pain faded as the day progressed and I got a quick work out in, which felt good. I like getting one day of kettlebells in a week since joining B2B.

Was minding my sisters dog today too, Loki. He's fun to hang around with. Went on a good long walk with him - nice walking with a dog.
