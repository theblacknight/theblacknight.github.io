Slept ok last night. Definitely better than the night before. Though when I woke up my left wrist was very sore. It has eased off a bit now, but is still pretty bad.

Wrist pain sucks. One of those body parts that I don't appreciate anywhere near enough... until it gets sore. 

Went for a little tour of [Back 2 Basics](https://www.getback2basics.ie/). Gonna start training there next week. Need to mix things up a little bit. Get under a barbell for a while. Will be interesting to see the impact on my overall strength.

They have dedicated mobility classes too, which is perfect for me.

This week and a half of logging everything has been interesting. My pain levels dropped immediately. Some of the numbers I'm putting in the pain register would have been much higher just one month ago. 

I reckon this is mostly because of two things:

* **Morning routine** 

	I think this is very valuable. A ten minute investment that yields great returns through out the day.

* **More hunger.**

	I am eating well, but avoiding snacking while also intermittent fasting. I seem to feel better physically when I'm a little it hungry. I definitely have problems if I eat too much over the course of a day, such that I'm never really hungry. Grazing. Not being overly strick on any of this.  

Excited to see how the coming weeks play out!
