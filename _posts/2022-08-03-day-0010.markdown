Didn't sleep well last night. Was just uncomfortable and my lower back was at me. Wondering if I need a new mattress. 

I feel like lack of movement when sleepng results in stiffness and pain. The longer I stay in bed, the more stiff I am in the morning.

Generally speaking, it's a bad idea for me to stay in one position for any significant amount of time.

Morning routine helped again. Already this feels like it's making a huge difference right through the day.

Good pressing day today. Left shoulder felt good. Probably the best it's been in a while. I found that adjusting my grip on the kettlebell while pressing actually helps with shoulder discomfort. No idea why.

Going for a chat with a coach at B2B tomorrow. Let's see about doing some barbell and mobility work with some professionals.
