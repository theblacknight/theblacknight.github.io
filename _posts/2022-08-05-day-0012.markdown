Woke up early today and decided to go for a hike. Did my short route up at Tibradden. Just over an hour, which is a pretty good time considering I haven't been up there in a while.

Felt it in my hip. Discomfort kicked in pretty quickly. Though I was able to stretch my way out of that when I got home, with some twists to free up the SI joint. 

Got  a short workout in too. Armor building complex along with some heavy presses. The 32kg bell is feeling pretty good now.

Pain score was pretty low today. Started at 13, finished at 8. Think that's the lowest I've have so far. Feels pretty good. Though my wrist is still not great, which does concern me.

Thinking about what to tweak next week. I think adding some routine around stretching throughout the day might be a good idea...
