Another lovely morning. Went for a medium length walk (around 35 mins). 

It's such a shame that the paths are empty at this time. I think a lot of people would really enjoy it if they got out early for a walk on beautiful day (provided they have that luxury).

Push day in the gym today. Didn't go too heavy - I think bench presses are my weakest movement. Much prefer overhead. 

Met up with some friends for a few beers and a pizza. Was good. Been way to long since we've hung out. Should try do that more. 

Also enjoying the bit of social contact in the gym... 

I was cynical about it at first, but I think a couple of years of covid and working from home has poisoned my mind a little bit. 

Gave myself a pretty high mood score today... probably not a coincidence.
