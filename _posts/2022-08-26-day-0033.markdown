BIG spike in pain score today. Basically doubled compared to earlier in the week. 

I feel like I overate yesterday - not in terms of calories, but feeling full.

I had lunch and then a busy evening of calls. As a result I ate dinner pretty late, and had a protein shake afterwards too. Then some snacks. So I felt a bit bloated.

I'm pretty confident that any sort of bloat will result in pain...

I was quite stiff all evening too. Had dinner from Cornucopia - probably over ate a bit again too, and felt it.

Also, looking back over the data, my pain scores seem to consistently go up towards the weekend. 

I think my eating habits change as the week progresses. I do shopping and food prep on the weekend. By Thursday most of that food is gone, so things get a bit more relaxed. Schedule starts to change too.

Need to have a think about this.
